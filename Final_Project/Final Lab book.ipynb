Furthermore, we will need a high speed shutter to block the imaging beam until we are ready to image the atoms.  We expect the process to be destructive, so we must have the shutter in place so the image beam interacts with the atoms only at the specific time we are interested in.  \n",

We considered elevating the black breadboard with some pillars to provide clearance for a large coil underneath it.  This might simplify placement of the various lenses and shutters we will need for the absorption imaging.\n",

He gave us some advice on how to modify our setup to optimize data collection.  He helped us find some software to run the the control, (namely, [Cicero](http://akeshet.github.io/Cicero-Word-Generator/Cicero%20Technical%20and%20User%20Manual.pdf), but after looking at the available drivers and support for our hardware, instead suggested using the [NI-DAQ USB-6009](http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.usb-6009.html) or an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).  However, after looking at the specifications, we are unsure if the accuracy and baud rate of the Arduino is high enough to achieve the desired timing of our shutters.\n",

    "The alignment of the imaging laser took the most time, as I had to place an optics track in the beam path without disturbing the rest of the setup.  Once this was done, I was able to easily build a Galilean beam expander.\n",

Once the drivers were successfully installed, I put the most recent version of Python on the machine and tested that everything works on the computer.  The next steps will be to understand how the NIDAQmx python library works to send triggers to the various drivers.\n",

    "* The periscope setup allows us to send the expanded beam directly through the MOT vacuum chamber.  However, even though the beam is expanded significantly and traverses several optical elements that should induce loss, the imaging beam is still too intense.  I will need to place an ND filter in line with the beam to sufficiently reduce its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the camera is placed in the best position without disturbing the MOT beam.  However, upon attempting to image the MOT, I found that imperfections on the container wall disturbed the image of the MOT.  I cannot get a very good picture of the MOT currently.  To test the quality, I observed the MOT through the camera while bringing a magnet near the chamber.  The image of the MOT \"jumped around\" as if there were an object in the way.\n",
    "    * I first used an air duster to try to remove surface dust from the outside of the container wall.  This did not help.\n",
    "    * Then, I used an isopropyl-soaked lens tissue to try to remove any remaining material.  This also did not help.\n",
    "    * I tried using the heat gun to vaporize any condensed Rubidium that might be on the inside surface of the cell.  While this made the MOT brighter, as well as the chamber overall, it still did not seem to alleviate the problem.  We will have to consult other experimental groups to see how they deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may have difficulty emplacing the shutter in the path of the trapping beam on the MOT table.  The beam travels very low to the optical table, and if the shutter is too big, it may not be able to allow the beam through.  Hopefully this isnt the case, but if so, we will need to find a way to block the MOT beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to build a circuit to shut off the magnetic field quickly.  I don't believe there will be time to incorporate compensation coils or their control boards in the time we have left, but we should be able to complete a board that can push the appropriate current through the coils to minimize the remaining field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to get a better grasp on the theory so we can build some hypothesis to compare our results to.  These include:\n",
    "    * If the expansion rate determines the temperature, then we need to know what factors determine the velocity distribution of the atoms in the MOT.  Presumably this includes the number of atoms, so we will probably need to image the stationary MOT several times to see what the average number of atoms is.\n",
    "    * Once we know the rough expansion rate of the cloud, we will be able to predict its size as a function of time.  Since it should be in a near vacuum, we should then be able to tell how much time has elapsed as a function of distance from the trap center (initial position).  This will provide a backstop on whether our camera is collecting images at the time we think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the biggest priority is to implement a program to control the shutters and the camera.  If nothing else, it will allow us to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of absorption imaging.  The above-mentioned issues remaining will be helpful if we can incorporate them (especially the ND filter), but will also be more along the lines of gravy."

I am going to experiment with getting the number of elements in the array to correspond to a desired time interval, but from a google search, it seems the internal timing of the USB-6009 is software dependent.

    "I can output a signal to each individual device, but I may need an intermediary to get the correct output once the signal is received.  For example, the imaging shutters are triggered on the downward slope of a signal, while the cameras and trap shutter might trigger on a different part of the signal.  However, I might be able to use this to my advantage if I code the controller with the intention of triggering on the relevant part of the signal.  In other words, to trigger the imaging shutters, I write the signal knowing that they will not activate *until the signal is diverted to another device*.  This might get to complicated, however, so I may just condition the controller to trigger once it recieves the signal (for uniformity and simplicity)."

    "I visited the JILA electronics shop to consult on why the previous day's circuit was not working.  They pointed out that the chip I am using, [CD4052BE](https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/894471.pdf), is designed to be operated at a high voltage, typically within analog circuits.  Since I am only interested in digital outputs, they suggested I look to the [SN74LS138 3-8 line decoder](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/sdls014/sdls014.pdf), and just ground the 3rd logic input.  This chip is much more 'digital friendly', operates at a power input of 5 V, and needs only 5 V on the logic gates.  However, this circuit is an 'active low' output, and the selected gate will go low.  I will have to modify my circuit to account for this.\n",
    "This 'active low' chip may actually be optimal for this situation.  The imaging shutters rely on a downward sloping signal, so there need not be any intermediary between the control board and those shutters.  According to the JILA electronics lab, most digital signals tend to be wired this way, as circuits tend to be great sinks, but not such great sources.  Therefore, things are triggered on the downside slope because these signals are cleaner and more precise time-wise.\n",

A cursory review of the online information relating to the Arduino suggests that it might even be better.  The device has its own internal crystal (which would probably allow a consistent timing signal), as well as multiple digital ports, which would allow us to bypass all of this circuit drama.

He pointed out that the misshapen fluorescence pattern of the MOT is more likely to be imperfections in the MOT than in the glass.  He demonstrated this by slightly toggling the mirrors directing the trapping/repump lasers into the cell.  In doing so, the MOT became much more symmetric.\n",

    "After wrangling with the code all night, I was able to get a program running that sends the proper signals through the output of each gate.  To test the responsiveness of the card, I had it switch voltages on both analog outputs as rapidly as possible.  I noticed that there is approximately a 0.4 ms delay between the switching of channels.  While this might be mitigated by the device through some function I am aware of, or by introducing a delay into the circuit, there is no time to implement such a solution.  I will move forward and keep this limitation in mind.  Since the maximum frame rate of the camera at maximum resolution is about 550 fps, this means there is a delay of about 2 ms between frames anyway, so we might not need to worry, provided we are imaging at larger time scales.\n",

It is partly up to the user to be able to provide the program with an accurate measurement of the frequency of the signals.  For an expected period of 100 ms, the device generated a signal that lasted 98.4 ms.  However, the calibration was performed using a signal of 100 counts, so with more precise calibration, we should be able to be more accurate with our timing.\n",

    "We spoke with Jun about the difficulty in obtaining an image.  He suggested we reduce the magnification of our imaging beam to increase the intensity of the imaging laser on our MOT.  He also advised us to make the MOT small enough that it's entire profile can be seen on the camera.  This will allow us to compare the position of the fluorescing MOT with the footprint of the imaging laser.  He also advised us to test the intensity of the laser on the MOT.  The saturation intensity of Rubidium 87 is approximately 1.4mW/cm^2, so we need to be under that level.\n",

    "We started making corrections to our setup by choosing new lenses for the beam expander and adjusting the separation distance between the two.  We ended up with 100 mm and -50 mm focal length lenses for a magnification of 2 and a separation of 50 mm.  While this is not a very large magnification, it turned out to be sufficient for the goals we mentioned above.  In order to correct the astigmatism of the beam, we elevated a metal annulus that is a platform for some of the newer table mounts.  The expanded beam passes through this and is quite circular on the camera.  While it is then a truncated gaussian, the truncated region is of no interest to us, so we do not lose anything.\n",

    "In addition to moving the tables around, Ben was able to fix the inverter on the control board to generate the desired output signal for the MOT shutter.  We were then able to incorporate all of our devices into the central control of the computer.  However, we noticed that when we were trying to turn on shutter 2 (control output 3), we kept triggering shutter 1 as well.  We realized this is due to the fact that the USB-6009 does not change the states of its outputs at the same time.  As noted earlier, there is a 0.5 ms delay between the changing output of signals.  This means that when the USB attempts to switch from channel 0 (null) to channel 3 (shutter 2), it makes an intermediate step at channel 2 (shutter 1).  This is because channel 0 is represented by 00, while channel 3 is give by 11.  The intermediate step can be either 10 or 01, and while this only lasts half a millisecond, it is sufficeint to trigger a device we do not wish triggered.  We solved this issue by removing shutter 2 from the circuit, and relying only on shutter 1 (channel 2) to control the imaging laser.\n",

    "We built a secondary circuit board to house the power supply and protect the driver for the MOT shutter as this driver requires 12-24 VDC to operate, and we want this kept separate from our other circuits, for the protection of all devices.  Now, the entire table is controlled by the computer.  The only other parameter we need to adjust is the imaging laser itself.\n",

    "Vandy came by and helped us dial in our imaging laser a bit.  On a suggestion from Ben, he used the TTL output on the function driver as the trigger for the oscilloscope, which worked wonders to improve our ability to dial in on the resonance peaks.  He also adjusted the trigger bandwidth to the 24MHz option, which reduced some of the 'squiggles' on the scan.  However, even once we were dialed in to the resonance peaks, we were still unable to get an absorption image of the atoms released from the MOT.  Vandy suggested that this is most likely due to our inability to lock the imaging laser.  If we were able to do this, it would be a much simpler matter.  However, we do not have the time to build a circuit to lock the laser in, so the manual toggling will have to suffice.\n",

    "In a Magneto-Optic Trap (MOT), atoms with an appropriate cooling structure are initially slowed by the use of Doppler Cooling, where counterpropagating lasers are red-detuned from a transition in an optical cooling loop.  Atoms moving *toward* one of these lasers will 'see' the light Doppler shifted towards the blue, and we be more likely to absorb a photon from this direction.  Once the photon is absorbed, the excited atom will emit a photon in a random direction.  Thus, on average, photons moving toward a laser will experience a force that opposes this motion.  The effect of the counterpropagating lasers is to slow atoms within the beam path of the lasers until they are nearly stationary relative to the two laser sources.  This doppler cooling is a velocity dependent force, and acts as a sort of friction.  By setting up counterpropagating beams along three orthogonal axes, we can create a region in space, defined by the intersection of these beams, where the velocity of these atoms is much reduced.  \n",

    "However, this only slows atoms within the beams.  It does nothing to localize the atoms in a region of space.  To accomplish this, we must introduce some sort of spatially dependent  Frictional, not positional.  Multiple coordinate axes."
