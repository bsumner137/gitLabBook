    "Bjorn was absent for this week on jury duty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this experiment is basically an extension and combination of the Laser Spectroscopy lab and the Atom Trapping lab, Ben spent the week setting up the work we had done before to combine the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we were able to choose a camera with a sufficiently high frame rate that we should be able to capture the expansion of the MOT. Furthermore, we will need a high speed shutter to block the imaging beam until we are ready to image the atoms.  We expect the process to be destructive, so we must have the shutter in place so the image beam interacts with the atoms only at the specific time we are interested in.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The camera we chose is the [Allied Vision Mako U-029B](https://www.alliedvision.com/en/products/cameras/detail/Mako%20U/U-029.html).  This is a CMOS camera with a resolution of 640x480, pixel pitch 4.8x4.8 $\\mu$m, and a 550 fps frame rate at maximum resolution.\n",

    "We had trouble getting the fine structure peaks to show up on the Laser Spectroscopy Table, so we had to rebuild the setup to increase the overlap between the probe and pump beams.  After careful alignment, the peaks became much more apparent, and we are now ready to use the beam pickoff to for imaging the MOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there was an issue with the laser servos not locking on the peaks.  According to the manual, when using the RAMP TTL on the back of the laser servo as the trigger, the trigger on the oscilloscope will need to be set to **positive** slope.  When in *side lock* mode, the servo will lock the laser \"...to the point where the DC ERROR crosses zero voltage with **positive** slope, and when the oscilloscope is triggering to the RAMP TTL with positive slope.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "I was unable to get a MOT for the longest time using this technique, while Ben was able to get it by flipping the sign of the gain and locking to the negative slope.  This puzzled me, but then Ben pointed out the oscilloscope was inverting the signal.  Once we put the oscilloscopes \"right side up,\" the trapping and pump lasers locked on the proper frequecy, and we obtained a MOT!\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Servoing the Trap and Pump Lasers**\n",
    "* Make sure LASER switch is set to OFF/RESET and LASER STATE to RAMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Turn on System Power to D2-005 and Oscilloscope.  Allow time for system to warm up.\n",
    "    * A green light next to T2 will turn on in $\\approx$ 1 minute.\n",
    "    * A green light next to T1 will turn on in $\\approx$ 2 minutes.\n",
    "    * If they turn red, there is an error condition.  Check manual.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Flip Laser switch to \"on\"\n",
    "    * A green light next to \"Laser On\" will appear, and $\\approx$ 5 seconds later the lasers should turn on.\n",
    "    * The laser contoller display should be $\\approx$ 148 mA for the Trapping laser, and $\\approx$ 139 mA for the repump.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Translate viewing window until the square wave (trigger signal) is positive.  This is the interval we will lock within.\n",
    "    * Ensure RAMP AMP on the laser servo is at maximum (far clockwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjust the coarse and fine controls until the desired hyperfine peak is roughly in the center of the positive square wave.\n",
    "    * Make sure oscilloscope is set to INVERT = OFF\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Slowly dial back the RAMP AMP (CCW) until the desired portion of the hyperfine peak is the only feature in the square wave.\n",
    "    * There is a point about which the entire spectrum expands when the RAMP AMP is dialed back.  It is here that we want our desired part of the spectrum to be.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* Once 'zoomed in' as much as possible, adjust the DC OFFSET tinpot with a screwdriver until the desired portion is at 0 V.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The laser locks to the point where DC ERROR crosses zero voltage with a positive slope AND when the oscilloscope is triggering to the RAMP TTL with positive slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Flip LASER STATE switch from RAMP to LOCK.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The DC ERROR should now be reading 0 V with some noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Adjust COURSE and FINE GAIN to minimize noise in DC ERROR.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ensure LD OUT is less than $\\approx$ 50 mV.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Laser is now locked.  If both lasers are locked to the correct transitions and the polarizations are correct (with Anti-Helmholtz coils active), a MOT should be forming in the chamber.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Laser Spectroscopy Table**\n",
    "Our intitial setup of the spectroscopy table did not provide sufficient resolution of the hyperfine peaks for this experiment.  We had to reset our tabletop to ensure a greater overlap of the probe beam with the pump beam.  Once this was complete, we found the enhancement of the hyperfine spectrum we desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Camera Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "We got the camera working on the NMR all-in-one yesterday, so we also built a mount for the camera and its lens.  We now have a mount that allows rotation (tilt) of the camera and its attached lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the angle of the camera relative to the height of the MOT has me cautious.  One of the features we will examine is the free fall of the MOT after shutting off confinement.  If the camera is not 'even' with the MOT, the distance we measure will be a projection in a different plane, not the true distance fallen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will need to put some lenses in place to have the largest numerical aperture possible and maximize the information available from the absorption imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had thought to place several lenses close to the MOT to form a telescope, but it might be tricky with the addition of the large lens added to the camera as it is currently setup.  We may need to replace the large lens currently installed with the smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Compensating Coils**\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discussed the optimal setup and placement for our compensation coils.  We want the coils large relative to the MOT to maximize the uniformity of the field at the MOT.  We considered elevating the black breadboard with some pillars to provide clearance for a large coil underneath it.  This might simplify placement of the various lenses and shutters we will need for the absorption imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additonally, each coil will need its own power supply to properly dial in the compensation field \n",
    "\n",
    "**Control Boards**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to put together seperate control boards for each of the compensation coils, as each one will have to individually be adjusted and the resulting field measured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we will need a 'master board' to control the shutdown of the confinement magnetic field simultanously with the removal of the confining laser beams.  A timer will then need to open the shutter of the imaging laser, and trigger the camera to take images."

    "We consulted with Ed Marti from Jun's group about integrating a controller into the overall shutter driver/camera setup.  He gave us some advice on how to modify our setup to optimize data collection.  He helped us find some software to run the the control, (namely, [Cicero](http://akeshet.github.io/Cicero-Word-Generator/Cicero%20Technical%20and%20User%20Manual.pdf), but after looking at the available drivers and support for our hardware, instead suggested using the [NI-DAQ USB-6009](http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.usb-6009.html) or an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).  However, after looking at the specifications, we are unsure if the accuracy and baud rate of the Arduino is high enough to achieve the desired timing of our shutters.\n",

    "\n",
    "The alignment of the imaging laser took the most time, as I had to place an optics track in the beam path without disturbing the rest of the setup.  Once this was done, I was able to easily build a Galilean beam expander.\n",

    "**Galilean Beam Expander**\n",

    "* Lens separation: $D = 250 \\text{ mm} + (-30 \\text{ mm}) = 220 \\text{ mm}$\n",
    "\n",
    "When I was testing the magnification, I found that the beam coming into the expander was very asymmetric.  Upon further research, I learned that solid state lasers such as the Vortex we are using tend to have this asymmetric profile (astigmatism).  However, by expanding the beam and passing it through several mirrors, the beam seemed sufficiently large so it should not be an issue for the experiments we intend to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the beam expander, I placed two shutters so as to control the exposure of the laser.\n",
    "\n",

The current settings for the controller are given below:\n",

    "#### Camera/Controller Setup\n",
    "Because the camera does not interface with my Linux system, I have had to install the NI-DAQmx drivers on the NMR experiment all-in-one computer.  Once the drivers were successfully installed, I put the most recent version of Python on the machine and tested that everything works on the computer.  The next steps will be to understand how the NIDAQmx python library works to send triggers to the various drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  We can make sure the NI USB-6009 is communicating with the computer by going to the \"Show hidden icons\" arrow in the bottom right corner of the screen.  Once there, we select the \"NI Device Monitor\" and see that the USB-6009 is detected.  By clicking on it, we can test and configure the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The camera is accessible through the \"Allied Vision Vimba -> Vimba Viewer\", which then brings up a GUI that allows us to select the MAKO U-029B Camera and collect images.  I believe I will be able to control the camera through python to collect images at specific times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problems/ Todo\n",
    "\n",
    "* The periscope setup allows us to send the expanded beam directly through the MOT vacuum chamber.  However, even though the beam is expanded significantly and traverses several optical elements that should induce loss, the imaging beam is still too intense.  I will need to place an ND filter in line with the beam to sufficiently reduce its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the camera is placed in the best position without disturbing the MOT beam.  However, upon attempting to image the MOT, I found that imperfections on the container wall disturbed the image of the MOT.  I cannot get a very good picture of the MOT currently.  To test the quality, I observed the MOT through the camera while bringing a magnet near the chamber.  The image of the MOT \"jumped around\" as if there were an object in the way.\n",
    "    * I first used an air duster to try to remove surface dust from the outside of the container wall.  This did not help.\n",
    "    * Then, I used an isopropyl-soaked lens tissue to try to remove any remaining material.  This also did not help.\n",
    "    * I tried using the heat gun to vaporize any condensed Rubidium that might be on the inside surface of the cell.  While this made the MOT brighter, as well as the chamber overall, it still did not seem to alleviate the problem.  We will have to consult other experimental groups to see how they deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may have difficulty emplacing the shutter in the path of the trapping beam on the MOT table.  The beam travels very low to the optical table, and if the shutter is too big, it may not be able to allow the beam through.  Hopefully this isnt the case, but if so, we will need to find a way to block the MOT beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to build a circuit to shut off the magnetic field quickly.  I don't believe there will be time to incorporate compensation coils or their control boards in the time we have left, but we should be able to complete a board that can push the appropriate current through the coils to minimize the remaining field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to get a better grasp on the theory so we can build some hypothesis to compare our results to.  These include:\n",
    "    * If the expansion rate determines the temperature, then we need to know what factors determine the velocity distribution of the atoms in the MOT.  Presumably this includes the number of atoms, so we will probably need to image the stationary MOT several times to see what the average number of atoms is.\n",
    "    * Once we know the rough expansion rate of the cloud, we will be able to predict its size as a function of time.  Since it should be in a near vacuum, we should then be able to tell how much time has elapsed as a function of distance from the trap center (initial position).  This will provide a backstop on whether our camera is collecting images at the time we think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the biggest priority is to implement a program to control the shutters and the camera.  If nothing else, it will allow us to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of absorption imaging.  The above-mentioned issues remaining will be helpful if we can incorporate them (especially the ND filter), but will also be more along the lines of gravy."
