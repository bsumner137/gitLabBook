Furthermore, we will need a high speed shutter to block the imaging beam until we are ready to image the atoms.  We expect the process to be destructive, so we must have the shutter in place so the image beam interacts with the atoms only at the specific time we are interested in.  \n",

After careful alignment, the peaks became much more apparent, and we are now ready to use the beam pickoff to for imaging the MOT.\n",

    "Furthermore, there was an issue with the laser servos not locking on the peaks.  According to the manual, when using the RAMP TTL on the back of the laser servo as the trigger, the trigger on the oscilloscope will need to be set to **positive** slope.

If the camera is not 'even' with the MOT, the distance we measure will be a projection in a different plane, not the true distance fallen.\n",

We considered elevating the black breadboard with some pillars to provide clearance for a large coil underneath it.  This might simplify placement of the various lenses and shutters we will need for the absorption imaging.\n",

    "\n",

    "We consulted with Ed Marti from Jun's group about integrating a controller into the overall shutter driver/camera setup.  He gave us some advice on how to modify our setup to optimize data collection.  He helped us find some software to run the the control, (namely, [Cicero](http://akeshet.github.io/Cicero-Word-Generator/Cicero%20Technical%20and%20User%20Manual.pdf), but after looking at the available drivers and support for our hardware, instead suggested using the [NI-DAQ USB-6009](http://www.ni.com/en-us/support/model.usb-6009.html) or an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/).  However, after looking at the specifications, we are unsure if the accuracy and baud rate of the Arduino is high enough to achieve the desired timing of our shutters.\n",

    "The alignment of the imaging laser took the most time, as I had to place an optics track in the beam path without disturbing the rest of the setup.  Once this was done, I was able to easily build a Galilean beam expander.\n",

Once the drivers were successfully installed, I put the most recent version of Python on the machine and tested that everything works on the computer.  The next steps will be to understand how the NIDAQmx python library works to send triggers to the various drivers.\n",

    "* The periscope setup allows us to send the expanded beam directly through the MOT vacuum chamber.  However, even though the beam is expanded significantly and traverses several optical elements that should induce loss, the imaging beam is still too intense.  I will need to place an ND filter in line with the beam to sufficiently reduce its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the camera is placed in the best position without disturbing the MOT beam.  However, upon attempting to image the MOT, I found that imperfections on the container wall disturbed the image of the MOT.  I cannot get a very good picture of the MOT currently.  To test the quality, I observed the MOT through the camera while bringing a magnet near the chamber.  The image of the MOT \"jumped around\" as if there were an object in the way.\n",
    "    * I first used an air duster to try to remove surface dust from the outside of the container wall.  This did not help.\n",
    "    * Then, I used an isopropyl-soaked lens tissue to try to remove any remaining material.  This also did not help.\n",
    "    * I tried using the heat gun to vaporize any condensed Rubidium that might be on the inside surface of the cell.  While this made the MOT brighter, as well as the chamber overall, it still did not seem to alleviate the problem.  We will have to consult other experimental groups to see how they deal with this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We may have difficulty emplacing the shutter in the path of the trapping beam on the MOT table.  The beam travels very low to the optical table, and if the shutter is too big, it may not be able to allow the beam through.  Hopefully this isnt the case, but if so, we will need to find a way to block the MOT beam.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to build a circuit to shut off the magnetic field quickly.  I don't believe there will be time to incorporate compensation coils or their control boards in the time we have left, but we should be able to complete a board that can push the appropriate current through the coils to minimize the remaining field.\n",
    "\n",
    "* We need to get a better grasp on the theory so we can build some hypothesis to compare our results to.  These include:\n",
    "    * If the expansion rate determines the temperature, then we need to know what factors determine the velocity distribution of the atoms in the MOT.  Presumably this includes the number of atoms, so we will probably need to image the stationary MOT several times to see what the average number of atoms is.\n",
    "    * Once we know the rough expansion rate of the cloud, we will be able to predict its size as a function of time.  Since it should be in a near vacuum, we should then be able to tell how much time has elapsed as a function of distance from the trap center (initial position).  This will provide a backstop on whether our camera is collecting images at the time we think it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "* I believe the biggest priority is to implement a program to control the shutters and the camera.  If nothing else, it will allow us to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of absorption imaging.  The above-mentioned issues remaining will be helpful if we can incorporate them (especially the ND filter), but will also be more along the lines of gravy."

I am going to experiment with getting the number of elements in the array to correspond to a desired time interval, but from a google search, it seems the internal timing of the USB-6009 is software dependent.  That is, it depends on the computer it is plugged into to determine what the timing is.
